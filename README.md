# pybinds
## Author: Frank William Hammond Espinosa

pybinds is a small program heavily inspired by my good friend Gerard's [flybinds](https://git.ricebes.cat/flybinds/file/README.md.html).

I created this after having used and loved flybinds for a long time, until I switched computers and started getting seemingly random segfaults which I really didn't want to debug. Python doesn't have those, so yeah.

### Dependencies:
A Python interpreter with the following libraries installed:

- python-xlib
- pillow (for rendering the text)
